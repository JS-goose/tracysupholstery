		<h1>Hi, I'm Tracy!</h1>
		<p>I have been working with upholstery for more than a decade. I have always enjoyed the work and found a sense of great accomplishment
			with this type of work. I treat each piece/job with the same level of efficiency and professionalism. I have worked on
			jobs as large as entire boats (60 feet yachts) needing all new interiors to jobs as small as bicycle seats. I believe
			that every job, no matter the size, is important and worth the same amount of effort. I feel that if the job is worth
			doing, it's worth doing right. That means using the right materials, hardware, and tools.
		</p>
		<p>I use only the highest quality, top notch materials in all of my work. I want everything I do for you to be weather-proof,
			rust resistant, and water-proof (if applicable). One of my greatest passions is my work and the service I provide to my
			customers. The peace of mind you get from knowing the job was finished right, the first time is why I do this.
		</p>
		<p>When you're ready to get started on your next project, check out the
			<a href="services.html">services</a> I have to offer. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns I would be happy to hear them. Please head
			over to my
			<a href="contact.html">contact page</a>
			and use any of the forms of communcation to get in contact with me.</p>
